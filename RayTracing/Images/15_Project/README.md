Description
-

The directory consists of three folders - `base`, `effects` and `animations`

## Base

- Here can be found the starting images which are used for generating the images with the effects and also the animations

## Effects

- Contains examples of the following effects, using the base images:
  - `fov`(field of view)
  - `spp`(sample per pixel)
  - `gi`(global illumination) 

## Animations

- The most interesting and important work can be found here. There are five videos, which demonstrate all important functionalities in the ray tracing project:

  - direct and global illumination
  - anti-aliasing
  - camera movements(zig-zag orbit, crane reveal and others)
  - modifying lighting and albedo dynamically
  - reflections and refractions
  - custom backgrounds and textures
  - accelerations
  - ...

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > All clips are generated in 20 fps, besides the video clip with global illumination applied, which is on 30 fps
