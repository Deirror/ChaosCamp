Big Thanks

I am truly thankful to the Chaos Camp Ray Tracing team. Being part of Chaos Camp has been a remarkable journey. I really appreciate the personal attitude which I received during the course. For sure I will keep on exploring this field where I can do what I love - apply mathematics to solve real-world problems.
